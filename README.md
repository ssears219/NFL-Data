# NFL Game Data Cleaning and Merging

Gathered NFL game data from various sources and merged into one file that includes game results, season statistics, and game weather information.

## Description

What is the association between various NFL statistics like passing yards per game, yards allowed per game, etc. and game results? Is there an association between gametime weather and a strong rushing offense winning?
Is home feild advantage real? To answer these questions, you first need a complete dataset which includes NFL Team statistics for each year, weather data from each game, and game results. In this project I gathered data from
various sources and merged them into one complete NFL game data set.
